                        I am a sociable guy, even if at first glance you would describe me as a quite and silent person.
                        The truth is I usually prefer to listen, rather than talk.
                        However, once I open up, I can even become the funny guy!

                        I like everything regarding informatics and technology, and, as the typical NERD,
                        I enjoy comics, movies, books and tv series.
                        Additionaly, I'm also keen on getting fit, and I regularly practice sports
                        (mostly alternating between swimming and jogging).

                        In the last three years, I have been a student of the Bachelor of Science
                        in Informatics at Università della Svizzera
                        Italiana in Lugano, where I currently live.

                        After graduating in February 2014, I worked as an intern software
                        developer for the multinational fashion firm Hugo Boss. It was a precious
                        experience for my growth, both as a human being and as a professional.

                        Since September 2014, I am attending a Master in Science of Informatics
                        at Università della Svizzera Italiana.
